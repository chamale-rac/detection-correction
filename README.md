## Overview

This project is the implementation of error detection and correction algorithms, specifically Hamming and CRC32, as part of the NETWORKS course at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG). These algorithms are fundamental to ensuring the integrity of data transmitted over communication networks.
